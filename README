sendgmail
=========

A simple email sender program using gmail smtp written in Go language.


Usage
=====

First, you should set a gmail account that SMTP is enabled.  In short, Settings
-> Forwarding and POP/IMAP -> Check 'Enable IMAP'.  That's it.

After your gmail account is ready, write down a file, `gmailinfo` on the
directory you are willing to execute this program.  `gmailinfo` file should
have account name and password of your gmail account, recipients, cc, bcc,
subject, and message which you are willing to send.  The file should be written
in jason format.  For example,

```
$ cat gmailinfo
{
	"Username":"sendgmail",
	"Password":"sendgmailpassword"
	"Recipients":"foo@bar.com",
	"Cc":"somebody@somewhere.com",
	"Bcc":"",
	"Subject":"Test for sengmail with CC and BCC",
	"Message":"Hello, this is test\n\nnew line is possible."
}
```

As you can see from the example, multiline message should write down '\n'
manually because json doesn't allow multi-line string.  If this makes you
uncomfortable, you can write your message in 'mailmessage' file.  It will
overwrite the message in 'gmailinfo'.

The path to the files can be changed by using command line options described
below.  Also, all information below can be overwritten by command line option,
seperatively.
